"""
IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ!

The pack/definitions.py version of this file is a symlink (created in the setup.py script) to the root definitions.py.
This is to give the pack "pseudo-package" access to root definitions. See README.md for more on the pseudo-package.
This does have some implications on how to use it, but if you follow the rules below, you should be fine.

RULES:
1. *Always use ROOT_PATH to get other paths*, leaving the ROOT_PATH logic in this file untouched.
2. Do not change the base structure of the modules directory, or move the symlinked definitions.py file.
3. Unless you're modifying fundamental framework logic or changing the directory structure of CodeMonkeys...
   YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T BE EDITING THIS!
