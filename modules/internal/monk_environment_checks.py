#  TODO (monk)
#   - Add a way to run a script with a flag that will run it in a new terminal tab
#   - Add a monk sub-command that allows the user to create or open a new version of an existing X after backing up old
#   - Add a monk sub-command that allows the user to create a new X from a template

#  TODO (organization)
#   - configs become subdirs of monkeys dir, and the monkey-manifest should be a file in the root directory
#     These directories will store existing configs, enabling the new/backup functionality above for monkey configs.
#     I had an idea related to internal/customizable but idk. Keep thinking, this is fertile ground.
