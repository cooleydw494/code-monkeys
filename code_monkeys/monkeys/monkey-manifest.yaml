#   Monkey Manifest Options
#
#   The Monkey Manifest offers robust configuration management for your automations,
#   enabling a variety of creative possibilities with the default main.py program and
#   other scripts in the programs/ directory. Monkeys provide a powerful and flexible
#   means to configure and share presets.

#   Ensure not to include sensitive information in your monkey-manifest.yaml when using
#   git (for a fork or contribution). If necessary, use `monk gitignore-monkeys` command
#   in the root directory to .gitignore the monkeys/ directory and export files.

#
#   Run `monk help [PROPERTY_NAME]` for more info.
#   All monkey-manifest properties can be defaulted in the .env file like so:
#   `DEFAULT_[PROPERTY_NAME]=[VALUE]`
#
#   *Prompts*
#   MAIN_PROMPT: The main prompt
#   SUMMARY_PROMPT: The prompt for summarizing the SPECIAL_FILE ("" to use verbatim SPECIAL_FILE contents)
#   USAGE_PROMPT: The prompt for generating guidance. ("" to use verbatim SPECIAL_FILE contents)
#   MAIN_PROMPT_ULTIMATUM: A final ultimatum for the main prompt ("" for none)
#
#   *Models*
#   MAIN_MODEL, SUMMARY_MODEL, and USAGE_MODEL: The model to use for respective prompts
#   Note: All models can be set to either 3 (gpt-3.5-turbo) or 4 (gpt-4).
#
#   *Overrides*
#   OVERRIDE_WORK_PATH: The path to the work_path to use. (Use absolute path or start with ~ for home dir on Mac/Linux)
#   OVERRIDE_PROCESS_FILE_FN: Override program's process_file fn (relative path from overrides/process_file/)
#   OVERRIDE_MAIN_PROGRAM: Override program's main.py from (relative path from programs/)
#
#   *Output*
#   OUTPUT_EXAMPLE: An example of the output you want to see. The generic-monkey has a good preset. ("" for none)
#   OUTPUT_CHECK_PROMPT: A prompt for checking the output. The generic-monkey has a good preset ("" to skip check)
#   OUTPUT_FILENAME_APPEND: Append to output filenames ("" for none, or "-summary", "-usage", etc.)
#   OUTPUT_EXT: Override output file extensions ("" for original ext, or ".md", ".txt", etc.)

# Future Monkeys
# I find it can be nice to take notes on monkey ideas in the form of just jotting down the names.
# I often have these ideas while editing the manifest, but don't want to get distracted.
# If you don't find this useful, feel free to delete this section.
