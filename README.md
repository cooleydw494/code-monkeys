# CodeMonkeys üêµüë®‚Äçüíª

Hi. Are you a moderately-to-highly technical individual with an interest in taking more control over your automated AI coding?
. . . . . . a lightly-technical individual who wants to try automated AI and can probably figure out how to edit a yaml file?
. . . . . . a creature with the capacity to learn how to press buttons and a strong motivation to do the AI?

Welcome to CodeMonkeys, a user-friendly _and_ power-user-friendly project designed to maximize the potential of the GPT API and streamline autonomous tasks with an emphasis on code generation and improvement. It's all about granting you, the user, full control and freedom to shape the AI's capabilities to your specific needs and ideas. Interested? Please scan the rest of the README, and if you find yourself intoxicated by the thought of wielding your own army of Monkeys, read the whole thing. If a great, but typical Github README is a tightly syncopated bop that everyone can groove to instantly, the CodeMonkeys README is a thorough and engaging concept album that conveys a subject intimately. Trust me, the version of you that reads the whole thing will run circles around the version of you that doesn't. Take the win.

## About The Author
I'm David. In the interest of establishing trust, I'll shortly describe myself, but then I'll swiftly move on. I'm a very-full-stack engineer with more than 5 and less than 50 years of experience in software dev, mostly web. A generic description of my roles would look something like "coder, lead coder, founder, coder". This project is good in creative ways and I have put a lot of love into it. It may be non-ideal in some ways I don't notice, but the way I see it, if I don't notice it, it isn't making it a bad project. I also believe that my Baby's First Python mentality, coupled with other coding experience and powerful AI models that can write Python very well, has led to an interesting and more-than-viable design.

## Overview üåê

CodeMonkeys, while maintaining a strong emphasis on coding tasks, is designed to be a purposefully more focused alternative to broad spectrum tools like AutoGPT. The goal is to reduce GPT API call wastage and provide more control, harnessing the power of automation for tasks that are reliable, predictable, and precisely tailored to user needs, only involving AI at crucial areas of strength. The project is built around a suite of adaptable Python scripts and user-friendly configuration utilities. This approach ensures that while you have a solid foundation for customization, you also maintain the efficiency and potency of the core framework. CodeMonkeys aims to strike a balance between adaptability and specificity, providing a less feature-rich but more extensible and capable tool for your unique automation needs.

# The Default Program (main.py)
The heart of CodeMonkeys is `main.py`, a generic but complete template for improving whatever is in your `WORK_PATH`. This file is the default entry-point and is designed to work well out of the box, and to be powerfully customizable using only `monkey-manifest.yaml` configurations. `main.py` is a top-down look at the default Monkey Program. During installation, a copy of this file is stored in `programs/my-first-program`. The `programs` directory is a location for your own variations of the main.py file, should you feel the urge to start writing your own programs. If you're thinking _"already there, pal"_, I see you, but I'd recommend you start by playing with the monkey-manifest and default program. If you're thinking _"that's too much, man"_, no worries, the default program and monkey-manifest are very powerful, and the proprietary programs in the `programs` directory will be expanded.

If the default program `main.py` is the heart of CodeMonkeys, then 

In addition to the monkey-manifest and main.py default program, CodeMonkeys commits to being moddable with a simple and powerful design for using/implementing `scripts`. The `scripts` directory is...

## Getting Started üöÄ

To get started, you'll want to [fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) the CodeMonkeys repository. Once you've done that, navigate to the CodeMonkeys directory in your terminal and run the install script with the following commands:

For Mac/Ubuntu
```bash
echo "BASE_DIR_ABS_PATH=$(pwd)" > .env && python3 scripts/internal/install/install.py
```
For Windows
```bash
Set-Content -Path ".env" -Value "BASE_DIR_ABS_PATH=$PWD"
python3 scripts/internal/install/install.py
```

## Usage üéÆ

CodeMonkeys operates via the `monk` command which runs Python scripts located in the `scripts` directory. For example, to kick off a monkey, simply use `monk kickoff [monkey-name] -n50`, where `n` is the maximum number of iterations to run. There is no default value for `-n` as a measure to encourage thoughtful use and provide a safety measure for those less familiar with the documentation.

If a monkey name is not provided, CodeMonkeys will check the .env file for a DEFAULT_MONKEY variable. If it exists, it will load the corresponding monkey configuration from the ../monkeys/[DEFAULT_MONKEY] directory.

## Customization and Updates üõ†

CodeMonkeys is designed to grow and adapt with you. The framework provides several built-in features that allow you to tailor the project to your needs.

- **Monkey-Manifest**: Define and manage your custom 'monkeys' or tasks in a centralized configuration file.

- **Local `.env` Files**: Manage your environment variables locally without affecting the global settings.

- **Import/Export**: Easily share your customizations or move between different systems.

    - **Export**: Use `monk export` to create an archive that includes your custom `main.py`, monkey configurations, and existing backups of your main file. The export is timestamped and can be moved to other systems or shared with others.

    - **Import**: Use `monk import [path-to-exported-file]` to import a previously exported archive. This will replace your current `main.py` and monkey configurations with those in the archive. But don't worry - before anything is replaced, your current `main.py` is backed up with a timestamp, and your backups are merged with those from the import.

We strive to make CodeMonkeys easy to update, even with your customizations. However, extensive modifications may complicate the update process. Please note that while we're working hard to make updates as seamless as possible, it's always a good idea to back up your work before updating.

For easy backup of your current `main.py`, simply run
```
monk backup "optional-custom-name"
```

## Directory Overview üìÅ

* `main.py`: Your primary customization file. Created by ./install
* `monk`: The command to run scripts.
* `monkeys`: Contains configurations for different 'monkeys' or tasks.
* `scripts`: Contains Python scripts to be run via the `monk` command.
* `monkeys/monkey-manifest.yaml`: The centralized configuration file for all monkeys.

## Convenience Tools
There are some tools I've found useful in development that I've left here for the sake of simplicity for myself and to allow others to use them.

# Commit Script
Starting whenever this was added, I'm trying hard to actually make frequent commits to document my progress, so as a lazy person I made a commit script that allows me to type a few characters, a commit message, and then perform a git add, a commit, and an optional push all at once. For me, this is nice, and I might start using it elsewhere. If you use ubuntu or macOS, you can use it like this:
```bash
./c "commit message"
```
