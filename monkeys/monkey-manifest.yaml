#   Monkey Manifest Options
#
#   The Monkey Manifest gives you a lot of customization options, effectively
#   creating preset config management for your automations. With the default
#   main.py program, Monkeys can accomplish a lot of creative things, which is
#   also true for any other programs in the programs/ directory. The combo
#   of config grouping via Monkeys and custom programs is powerful and flexible.
#   Monkeys are also a way for you to organize and share your own presets, and the
#   monkey-manifest.yaml file is included in the built-in export/import functionality.

#   Do not include any sensitive info in your monkey-manifest.yaml if you are
#   using git for the repo (developing a fork or contributing). If you must,
#   you should .gitignore both the monkeys/ directory and export files by running
#   `monk gitignore-monkeys` in the root directory of your project.
#
#   Run `monk help [PROPERTY_NAME]` for more info.
#   All monkey-manifest properties can be defaulted in the .env file like so:
#   `DEFAULT_[PROPERTY_NAME]=[VALUE]`
