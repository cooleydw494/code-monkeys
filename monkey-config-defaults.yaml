# Monkey Config Defaults
#
# This file is used to set default values for monkey configs.
# It is also the source of truth for all monkey config options, so if you add or alter
# something here, it is written to the MonkeyConfig class and .env.default.
# (you must update .env manually)

# RULES
# - Keys must be SNAKE_CASE
# - Keys with a word-boundaried "PATH" are validated as PATH
# - Keys with a word-boundaried "PROMPT" are validated as PROMPT
# - Keys with a word-boundaried "MODEL" are validated as MODEL
# - Keys with a word-boundaried "TEMP" are validated as TEMP
# - Other keys are validated as primitives (str, bool, etc)
#
#   PATH values will replace 'ROOT_PATH' with your project's root path
#
# - Validation logic is defined in
#   `pack/modules/core/config_mgmt/monkey_config_validations.py`
