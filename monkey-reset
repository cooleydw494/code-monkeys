# Prepare for a new Monkey Process run, which should be done every time a new Monkey is initialized
# Don't forgot to manually ingest the files in VirtueMasterTxt, by running `python3 data_ingestion.py --dir VirtueMasterTxt --init --overlap 300 --max_length 8000` in the AutoGpt directory
# IMPORTANT: Only ingest pre-seeding data from VirtueMasterTxt after the datastore is initiated when you run the next Monkey

# Remove the file_logger.txt file because the next Monkey will not be able to duplicate write/append actions otherwise
rm file_logger.txt

# Remove the VirtueMasterTxt file so we can re-create it clean
rm -rf VirtueMasterTxt

# Run the command to re-create the VirtueMasterTxt file for ingestion
python3 ./convert_vm_to_txt.py


# again, don't forget to ingest the files LOLMAO
